 * --------------------------
 * The StoneMasonKarel subclass as it appears here does nothing.
 * When you finish writing it, it should solve the "repair the quad"
 * problem from Assignment 1.  In addition to editing the program,
 * you should be sure to edit this comment so that it no longer
 * indicates that the program does nothing.

/*
 * File: CheckerboardKarel.java
 * ----------------------------
 * When you finish writing it, the CheckerboardKarel class should draw
 * a checkerboard using beepers, as described in Assignment 1.  You
 * should make sure that your program works for all of the sample
 * worlds supplied in the starter folder.
